## HTML Basics
- Generic text like in a <p> is 16px at Times New Roman with specific spacing.
- Browser has style sheet of its own. 
- <p> comes with spacing at top and bottom of paragraph.
- <h1> to <h6> for header tags.
- Lists can be <ul> and <ol>. Have <li> inside.

## HTML Links, Headings, & Images
- https - "s" stands for secure connection w/ encryption.
- Tags (a href="") are nouns and attributes are descriptions (target="_blank").
- When we link to pages on our website we link in same window. External links get target="_blank".
- Which headings to use. Where list occurs and what function is it performing. In practice, you rarely get past an H3. Similar to writing a paper. More stylistic choice.
- Space and returns have no reflection on webpage.
- Tag - identifies portion of the document.
- Element same thing as tag, often used interchangeably.
- Attribute - arguments to tags or descriptions to tags.
- Photoshop images are rastors, built with series of pixels.
- SVGs are mathematical images.
- For images, width and height are not best attributes. Best to resize in a separate program.

## HTML Extras
- Quotes on webpage, use <blockquote>
- <em> for emphasis, <strong> for strong emphasis, neither to be confused with <bold> or <italicize>
- HTML validator - https://validator.w3.org/
- Image resize - can resize in webpage with HTML & CSS but shouldn't do it that way. Should resize in another program before linking HTML page.
- Can use Preview on Mac or check online.
- How big the picture should be depends on what you are building. Subjective.
